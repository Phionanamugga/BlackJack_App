1. This is a game played using cards. It is played in a way that you get the largest number without going over 21.
2. If the cards in one's hands go over 21, the handler loses
3. Cards counting 2-10, are read with their face value e.g; 2 counts 2, 9 counts 9.
4. J, Q, and K count as 10
5. A counts as either 1 when just going over 21 or when way below 21, it counts as 11.
